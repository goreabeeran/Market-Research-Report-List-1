<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigeration Tunnel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Cooling</li><li>Air-cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The refrigeration tunnel market is primarily segmented into liquid cooling and air-cooling systems. Liquid cooling utilizes chilled liquid, often circulated through pipes, to efficiently lower temperatures for food products as they pass through the tunnel, ensuring rapid cooling without compromising quality. In contrast, air-cooling systems rely on powerful blowers to circulate cold air around the product, providing a more straightforward setup. Both methods aim to enhance preservation and shelf-life in food processing and manufacturing industries, but they differ in efficiency and application.</p></p>
