<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plunger Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Balanced Plunger Valve</li><li>Disc Unbalanced Plunger Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plunger valve market is segmented into disc balanced and disc unbalanced types. Disc balanced plunger valves maintain equal pressure on both sides of the disc, offering improved stability and reduced risk of vibration. They are ideal for high-pressure applications. In contrast, disc unbalanced plunger valves have uneven pressure distribution, which can lead to faster wear and tear, but they can be more cost-effective and simpler in design. Each type serves specific industrial needs based on performance and operational requirements.</p></p>
