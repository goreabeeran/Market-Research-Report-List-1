<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal devices market encompasses two primary types: spinal fusion and non-fusion products. Spinal fusion devices are designed to stabilize the spine by fusing vertebrae together, often using rods, screws, or cages, effectively alleviating pain and restoring mobility. In contrast, non-fusion products aim to stabilize the spine without permanently joining vertebrae, utilizing techniques such as dynamic stabilization or motion preservation. These innovations enhance flexibility and reduce complications associated with surgical interventions, catering to a diverse range of patient needs.</p></p>
