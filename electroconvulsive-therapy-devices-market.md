<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electroconvulsive Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unilateral</li><li>Bilateral</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) devices are classified into two main types: unilateral and bilateral. Unilateral ECT targets one hemisphere of the brain, typically the right side, which can lead to fewer cognitive side effects while still providing therapeutic benefits. In contrast, bilateral ECT stimulates both brain hemispheres simultaneously, often resulting in quicker responses for treating severe depression but with a higher risk of cognitive side effects. The choice between these types depends on individual patient needs and treatment goals.</p></p>
