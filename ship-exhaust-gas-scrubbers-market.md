<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Scrubbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ship exhaust gas scrubbers market includes three main types: open loop, closed loop, and hybrid scrubbers. Open loop scrubbers utilize seawater to neutralize sulfur oxides, discharging treated water back into the ocean. Closed loop scrubbers use a recirculating system with an alkaline solution to treat exhaust, allowing for on-board water disposal. Hybrid scrubbers combine both systems, offering flexibility to operate as open or closed loop based on circumstances, making them suitable for various regulatory environments.</p></p>
